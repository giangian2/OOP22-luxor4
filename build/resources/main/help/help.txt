Once this will occur, you have to start again on level 1.

The goal of the game is to eliminate all the balls before
they enter in the final hole. 
To eliminate them, there has to be 3 or more balls of the same color.

You will use a cannon to shot at them (BUTTON SPACE).
The cannon can move to the right (RIGHT ARROW) and to the left (LEFT ARROW).

Good luck!
